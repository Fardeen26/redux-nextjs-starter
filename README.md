# Redux Starter for Next.js

This is a simple Next.js starter project with Redux integrated. It features a basic counter application to demonstrate how to set up and use Redux in a Next.js environment.

## Features

- **Counter Example**: A basic counter to illustrate Redux actions, reducers, and store setup.

## How Redux is Integrated

1. **Store Setup**:
   - Located in `src/store/store.ts`.
   - Configured using `@reduxjs/toolkit`.

2. **Slice Example**:
   - A `counterSlice` is defined in `src/features/counter/counterSlice.ts`.
   - Includes actions like `increment`, and `decrement`.

3. **Provider**:
   - The Redux store is wrapped around the application in `src/store/StoreProvider.tsx` using the `Provider` from `react-redux`.
